Lab0: Setting up github and self-introduction
## Intro!
Please provide a brief self-introduction below (year, hometown, favorite food, anything you would like to share with us!) to help us get to know you a little better :) 


Hi! My name is Alaena - I graduated from Brown as an undergrad in 2020, so this is my first and only year in the 5th year Masters program. I am from Seattle, and my favorite dinner food is Udon noodles, and my favorite dessert is cotton-candy ice cream. I was on the rowing team at Brown, but now my main hobby is quilting. :)
